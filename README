"Low-Rank Adaptation" (LoRA) represents a form of "parameter efficient fine tuning" (PEFT) designed to fine-tune large models using 
a minimal number of learnable parameters. This approach revolutionizes fine-tuning through several key concepts:

Redefining Fine Tuning: LoRA approaches fine tuning as learning changes to parameters rather than adjusting the parameters themselves. 
This perspective shift involves freezing the original model parameters and focusing on learning the necessary changes for improved 
performance in specific tasks.

Compression of Changes: It seeks to compress these parameter changes into a more compact representation by eliminating redundant information. 
This step is crucial for making fine-tuning more efficient and manageable.

Application of Changes: The method involves simply adding these compressed changes to the pre-trained model parameters, streamlining the fine-tuning process.

Though these concepts may initially seem complex, LoRA simplifies the fine-tuning process. Traditional fine tuning involves iteratively updating model 
parameters based on the accuracy of inferences. LoRA, however, updates the changes in model parameters rather than the parameters themselves. This subtle 
yet significant difference makes fine-tuning more efficient in terms of data and processing, addressing the challenge of enhancing model performance 
without the need for extensive adjustments or resources.

LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) reimagines the concept of fine-tuning in machine learning, particularly for large language models. Unlike traditional methods 
that adjust model parameters directly, LoRA focuses on learning changes to these parameters through a matrix factorization approach. This process is grounded 
in the understanding that weight matrices in large language models exhibit significant linear dependence due to overparameterizationâ€”a trait beneficial in 
pre-training but excessive for fine-tuning.

The key steps in LoRA's approach are as follows:

Parameter Freezing: The original parameters of the model are frozen and not updated directly

Matrix Creation: Two smaller matrices are created for each weight matrix in the model. These matrices, when multiplied, match the size of the corresponding weight matrix.

Calculating the Change Matrix: The input is processed through both the frozen weights and the newly created matrices, generating a change matrix.

Optimization: The matrices are optimized based on the loss calculated from the combination of outputs from the frozen weights and the change matrix. This optimization is 
more efficient due to the smaller size of the matrices compared to the full model parameters.

Efficient Backpropagation: Updating these smaller matrices is faster than updating the entire set of model parameters, making LoRA quicker than traditional fine-tuning methods 
despite involving additional operations.


Application in Inference: For inference, the computed change matrix is added to the weights, without altering the model's inference time. LoRA also allows for scaling the impact of 
the change matrix on the model, offering flexibility similar to techniques used in image generation.

LoRA thus offers a more efficient, faster approach to fine-tuning large models, reducing the amount of information and parameters needed post pre-training, while still maintaining 
the efficacy and speed of the model during inference.
